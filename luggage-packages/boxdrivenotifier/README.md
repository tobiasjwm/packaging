# boxdrivenotifier

A script and LaunchAgent to notify employees that Box Drive is available and point them to a Munki self-serve install.

This project requires that Yo! 2.0 or > is installed on a device. For more information, see the [Yo! Github repo](https://github.com/sheagcraig/yo).

## Changes for Yo! 2.0

Refactored the script to work with Yo! 2.0 by removing custom icon (we build our own Yo with our icon).

Ignore the things in `nopkg_testing`. I can't ever throw things away.
