## Installing Box Tools

This solution requires [outset](https://github.com/chilcote/outset) to configure the local user settings. The script 'boxedit-install.sh' is installed in the `/usr/local/outset/login-once` directory.

Box Tools v4.x introduced changes that require adding proxy settings to enable the local user. You can find out more by visiting the [Large Scale Deployments: Box Tools](https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-Admins/Large-Scale-Deployments-Box-Tools/ta-p/6591) KB article.

For v4, it is necessary to run the local install script again.
